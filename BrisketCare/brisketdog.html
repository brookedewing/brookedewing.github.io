        <h3 id="food">Food and Treats</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><bold>Regular Food: </bold>Slightly over 1.5 cups, twice per day</li>
          <li class="subtext">- Timing isn't super important, he usually gets breakfast whenever we get up (<emphasis>anywhere between 7:30am and 9:30am</emphasis>) and has dinner around when we eat (<emphasis>anywhere between 5:30pm and 7:00pm</emphasis>)</li>
          <li><bold>Treats: </bold></li>
          
          <li class="subtext">- Our training treats are super low-cal, so feel free to give him these as needed for coercion or when you feel like having him do some tricks.</li>
          <li class="subtext">- He also gets one small piece of milkbone when getting in bed every night :)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <div class="info 2">
          <h3 id="routine">Routines</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><bold>Exercise: </bold>Generally either two smaller outings (e.g. mile or so walk) or one larger one (longer walk or play time at dog park)</li>
            <li class="subtext">- For example, if I'm just doing one long walk with him, I'll take him from our house up to Roanoke Park and play ball/chase him around, then we'll do the trails that go around the park! (<emphasis>probably about 3ish miles total</emphasis>).</li>
            <li class="subtext">- If I remember, I'll incude his red wobbly thing that you can fill with breakfast or dinner and add a few treats. This can entertain him for awhile- it's not exactly exercise, but can help if he's bored!</li>
            
            <li><bold>Bathroom Breaks: </bold>He usually goes out right after we get up and right before we go to bed, but other than that he doesn't really have a potty routine. We're a little spoiled having the fenced in backyard, so I don't pay enough attention to know how many times he goes per day, but he generally seems to poop about twice a day :) </li>
            <li class="subtext">- <emphasis>I attached my house key</emphasis> to the bag all of his stuff is in. That way, if we realize we've forgotten something you need, or even if you'd just like to hang out and let him go in and out with the fenced yard, you have options :)</li>
  

            <li><bold>Kennel: </bold>When we put him in there, we generally give him one of his nylabones to chew on (the maroonish/pink plastic bone things) and a blanket and then just give him like five training treats and he's pretty happy.</li> 
            <li class="subtext">- If we're going to be gone for a few hours or more/he hasn't eaten his breakfast yet, I'll also put his water and/or food in there as well.</li>   
          </ul>

        <h3 id="tricks">Tricks and Accompanying Hand Signals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><bold>Sit: </bold>Palm facing self and fist upwards (<emphasis>e.g. closed fist facing yourself if that makes more sense</emphasis>)</li>
          <li><bold>Stay: </bold>Hand in <emphasis>Stop Sign</emphasis> position</li>
          <li><bold>Shake: </bold>Hand in <emphasis>Low-Five</emphasis> Position</li>
          <li><bold>Shake (Other Paw): </bold>After asking him to shake one paw, switch your hands and say "<emphasis>Other Paw</emphasis>"</li>
          <li><bold>High Five: </bold>Hand in <emphasis>High-Five</emphasis> Position ("<emphasis>Other Paw</emphasis>" also works for this)</li>
          <li><bold>Lay Down: </bold>Hold food toward floor</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="info 3">
        <h3 id="keywords">Key Words</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><bold>Get Ready: </bold>You can say "should I get ready?" if you want to get him hyped for a walk (he also knows the word walk!)</li>
          <li><bold>Bedtime: </bold>He knows this means one more chance to go to the bathroom and then a treat and sleep time is coming.</li>
          <li><bold>Go Potty: </bold>Pretty self-explanatory. Use this if he gets distracted while you're trying to get him to go to the bathroom. <emphasis>We also feel a bit silly saying this one if that makes you feel any better...</emphasis></li>
          <li><bold>Can you come here?: </bold> Sometimes more effective than just "come here" for some reason.</li>
          <li><bold>Let's Go: </bold>Phrase for getting him to move along on a walk if he stops to sniff or something for too long</li>
          <li><bold>Drop it/Can I have it?: </bold>If he has something in his mouth you want or that shouldn't be in there</li>
          <li><bold>Leave it: </bold>If he's sniffing something gross or won't let you pick up a ball while playing/etc.</li>
          <li><bold>Can you get in your kennel?: </bold>Self-explanatory!</li>
          <li><bold>Can you get your... : </bold>e.g. ball, toy, etc. </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="info 3">
        <h3 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>- He's super sweet to other dogs and people but some people seem to be nervous of him, so I always ask if he can say hi before approaching. He'll also stop in his tracks/sometimes lay down on walks if he wants to go see another dog - NBD, just a little annoying</li>
          <li class="subtext">- Also, be aware of cats and squirrels! He will lunge at both and goes a little crazy sometimes when he sees a kitty cat.</li>
         <li>- <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Penn+Valley+Off+Leash+Dog+Park/@39.073878,-94.5879936,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7fdc1d7c5614f2f0?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJjr2t38z8AhUNkokEHbwBDogQ_BJ6BQiGARAI" target="_blank">Penn Vally Dog Park</a></bold> is a good place to take him! You might want to take treats in case you need to talk him into leaving</li>
         <li>- If you take him to any pet friendly stores, be ready to have your arm almost yanked off as he tries to get to the front of the store for treats :) </li>
        <li class="subtext">- We take him into Ace Hardware and Mike's Liquor pretty often and sometimes Home Depot.</li>
        <li class="subtext">- Also, The lady (Ann) who normally works Friday evenings at Records with Merritt loves him and he loves her (food).</li>
