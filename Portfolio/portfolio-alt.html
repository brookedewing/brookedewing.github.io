        <h1>Hello, <br>I'm Brooke Dewing</h1>
         <p>I am an accountant by trade and have been living and working in the Kansas City Area for almost 8 years now!  <!--and am currently working toward becoming a full-stack engineer. --> I am driven by my curiosity, the opportunity to learn new skills and the chance to help others.</p>

    <div class="aboutme">
      <h2 class="title2">A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>I have a slight obsession with solving problems, which is what led me into the accounting field while studying at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I enjoy working by myself, but also love the growth that comes from collaborating with others.
      <br><br>I am currently looking for part-time work because, though I have an affinity for logic and organizing data, like many of us in these types of roles I also have a creative side and love the balance that comes from the ability to express each throughout my week. I currently have a few side hustles that I love that have provided me incredible flexibility to explore various projects and continue to grow in new and unexpected ways.
      <br><br>I have a gap in my work history due to a sabbatical taken in order to pursue personal growth, but I am confident I can bring meaningful contributions future organizations and will be an asset to any Finance Department. If you have any interest in discussing potential roles (even if only temporary help is needed!) please do not hesitate to <a href=mailto:dewingbrooke@gmail.com>reach out.</a>
      <br><br>
      In addition to my professional roles, I enjoy painting, learning to code, gardening, <a href="https://brookedewing.github.io/Desk/desk.html">refinishing furniture</a> and hanging out with my significant other and our wonderful dog!
      </p>
      
      <!--However, after some years experience and an exploration of my career goals, I realized my aspirations didn't quite align with the traditional path of accounting. So, I am taking the knowledge and thought processes I have gained and am using them to my advantage while exploring the world of programming. <br><br>Now that I am here, I believe I have found my passion! I really enjoy the creativity involved and look forward to the opportunity to further my education and increase my skills.-->
