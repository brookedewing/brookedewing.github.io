        <h2 class='title2'>Where to Begin?</h2>
        <p>Though I grew up working alongside my parents on miscellaneous carpentry and DIY projects, I think my role
        probably would have been considered closer to a 'go-pher' rather than an assistant. Thus, taking on this project
        brought along a lot of questions (what tools do I need?, where to start?, why did I get myself into this?).</p>

          <figcaption class='caption'>Desk: Day 1</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class=standardtext>Since I was starting basically from scratch, I decided my first tool purchase would be a
        sander - though I have heard the merits of the orbital, I decided to just go with a plain ol' palm sander. Once I
        had gotten started, I talked to my parents about their experience and recommendations on the next tool to get. It
        turns out (thankfully!) that they had been planning on getting me a gift for a birthday we had missed during COVID
        and thus, I got a brand new jigsaw! </p>

        <h2 class='title2'>First Steps</h2>
        <h3 class='title3'>1: Remove Peeling Veneer and Patch</h3>
        <p class='standardtext'> Though the top and drawers on this piece are solid wood, the sides and a few other places
        are thin plywood with veneer. I picked this piece up from the curb and I'm assuming it got a bit of water damage
        before I found it
        <p>

        </figure>

        <h3 class='title3'>2: Sand Down Top to Remove Existing Finish</h3>
        <p class='standardtext'> For this piece, I wanted to keep as much of the original character as possible, so when I
        found the top had a beautiful light wood underneath, I was pretty excited!
        <p>

        </figure>

        <h3 class='title3'>3: Now it's Time to Prime, Paint and Stain!</h3>
        <p class='standardtext'> I decided to paint the body of the desk in a nice dark green and to stain the top and drawer fronts. I then decided to add a fun hidden pop of color by painting the interior of the drawers in a brownish pink!<p>
        <figure>
          <img src='./resources/images/paint1.jpg' height="" width="420" />

          <img src='./resources/images/paint4.jpg' height="" width="420" />
        </figure>

        <h3 class='title3'>4: Dealing with the Pencil Chasm</h3>
        <p class='standardtext'> After about six months of putting off adding any finishing touches, I got a stroke of inspiration while working on another project for my boyfriend. This desk has a top that ends before the back, leaving what I like to call a pencil chasm. I had been going back and forth on what I wanted to do with it and just happened to prop his family's old circular table up behind the desk whily tidying one day. Lo and behold, I realized I like the look of the half circle! So, I set out to build one.<p>
        <figure>
          <p>Alright, to start I had to do some math and pull out some tools & parts of my brain that haven't been used in quite a long time. Then, I cut some boards roughly to size and cut and glued dowels into each board to increase the stability and decrease the warpage. <note>(Confession: this took a LOT of trial and error in order to get them perfectly aligned and there may be about 10 extra holes in these boards...)</note></p>

          <img src='./resources/images/back1.jpg' height="" width="420" />
          <img src='./resources/images/back2.jpg' height="" width="420" />
          <img src='./resources/images/back3.jpg' height="" width="420" />
          <p>Once the glue had dried, I created a contraption out of scrap wood, a pencil, blue tacky, and string in order to make a DIY compass and draw my curve. <note>(A quick note in case you're working on something similar - I did a very rudimentary version of this process before finalizing how I wanted my boards to lay and adding the dowels. I found this super helpful in making sure everything laid out right and the graining looked good together.)</note>
          </p>
          <img src='./resources/images/back4.jpg' height="" width="420" />
          <img src='./resources/images/back5.jpg' height="" width="420" />
          <img src='./resources/images/back6.jpg' height="" width="420" />
          <p>After cutting and sanding to the shape I wanted and making sure everything was smoothed out, we decided it might look better if the wood was more discernable from the top. Since I didn't want to deal with the chemicals necessary for bleaching the wood, I decided to do a paint wash instead! I mixed 1 part latex paint with 1 part water and applied with a brush, then wiped away with a cloth. This way, the graining was still visible, but the wood had a nice bleached look!</p>
